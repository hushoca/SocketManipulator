You can run the application on the CMD line to see the necessary params.
The OutgoingHandler.js handles the requests that are being sent from the local to the target
and the IncomingHandler.js handles the requests that are being sent from target to local.

By modifying the JS code in these files you can log, edit or do whatever you want to the
requests and responses.
